Real branch predictors work on a window of fetch data.

I don't really care, was planning on doing a BTB loopup 
on each /instruction/. This is interesting. This can either 
be achieved--for x86--by storing the decoded length of each instruction
and doing a PC+/variable length/ for each instruction... which is cheating. 
Or by doing a BTB lookup on EVERY BYTE. 

Now that I think of it, I should implement it as a fixed window with offsets.
