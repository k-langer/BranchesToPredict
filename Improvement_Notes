The simulator needs to be rewritten. It was a good first start but I made it difficult to fix. 

Things it needs to do natively: 

Provide predictions on a fixed window.

Each cycle the predictor will look at a 64B block and produce a prediction. 
  Need to allow start point to be factored into that prediction 
  Likely need to have a BTB indexed by configurable hash of start and VA information 
  
Need to structure the BTB so that wayness and replacement can be handled natively. 
  Meta-meta BTB ptr. Meta BTB with a list of pointers and replacement info. Entry with contents and tags
Want size to be paramaterized, also wayness

Provide a way to add conditional predictor easily

How about return stack? Looping patterns? Indirects? 

Things not to hard code:
  Entrys
  Ways
  Tag compare size
  LRU
  Last level BTB
  indexing 
  Window size
